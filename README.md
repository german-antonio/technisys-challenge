# Technisys Code Challenge
Code challenge resolution for a job application at Technisys

## Prerequisites
In order to run this project you need to have NodeJS installed (along with NPM).
Optionally, Docker will be needed to run the containerized version (see below).

## Installation

### Local
Clone the repository into your local machine and then run
```
npm install
```
This will install required npm packages.

### Containerized version
If you'd prefer to run the containerized version, go to [Link to dockerhub here].

## Usage

### Local
On a terminal, navigate to the repository's directory, and type
```
npm start
```
You can also run
```
npm test
```
if you want to run the unit tests and check their coverage.

### Containerized version
Open a connection to the container with
```
command-to-enter-container
```
Once inside, follow the same instructions for the local version (it will run inside the container).
